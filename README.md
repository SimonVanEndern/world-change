# world-change
This repository is meant to contain and collaborate on a shared vision / mission to change the world for the better.

# Contribution
We encourage each and every individual to contribute to these documents. Help to improve them and help to bring them to live.

# Why
There are many people in the world working on improving things. We want to align them all with one shared vision.
This way everybody will be more connected, feel more inspired and have more guidance in order to achieve one common vision.

# Structure
From the [shared vision](vision.md) we derive our [Obejctives and Key Results](okrs.md).
